        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Riley Tucker. I am 27 years old. I was born in Lansing, MI on November 17th, 1994 at approximately 8am.
        I am a 5th year Computer Science major at Michigan State University taking a cognate in Media and Information.
        I first decided I wanted to pursue a career in computer science around 2016 after unfortunate life circumstances forced me to consider my
        future more seriously. I had always had an interest in becoming a game developer, but had often heard that those positions can be pretty
        nightmarish when first starting out, so I decided I would obtain the skillset to become a software developer and build my portfolio of work
        so that I could have an advantageous position when attempting to enter the game dev industry, instead of attempting to enter as a college graduate
        begging for a job in a field in which I have no experience. Some games that inspire me to wish become a game developer include:</p> 
        <ul>
            <li>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</li>
            <li>Hollow Knight</li>
            <li>Stardew Valley</li>
            <li>Forager</li>
            <li>Littlewood</li>
            <li>Terraria</li>
            <li>Risk of Rain</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I also play guitar and do vocals in a metal band and 
        have several hobbies focused around music including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Playing Guitar</li>
            <li>Doing Vocals</li>
            <li>Writing Music</li>
            <li>Performing with my Band, Son of Scylla</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I have many dreams and aspirations and the past 5 years have been a struggle to determine in what I wish to specialize and excel. Sadly, though music is my passion,
        I have mostly ruled it out as a career choice and now consider it more as a secondary skill that can be used to further my aspirations to be a game developer. The income
        from music, especially in my genre of choice (metal) is fairly inconsistent/unpredictable and unlikely to ever be adequate and even less likely to be excessive. </p>
